Dynamic CPU Scheduling Simulator is an interactive, web-based tool designed to demonstrate and analyze the behavior of various CPU scheduling algorithms with a strong emphasis on energy efficiency. This simulator supports key algorithms such as First-Come First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin, making it a valuable educational resource for students and developers learning operating system concepts.

The tool offers real-time Gantt chart visualization for process execution, allowing users to see how tasks are scheduled and completed over time. It also integrates energy consumption analytics, helping users understand the trade-offs between speed and power usage in different scheduling scenarios. Tasks can be classified into different priority levels—System, Interactive, and Background—to simulate real-world multitasking environments more accurately.

Users can toggle between three operational modes: Eco Mode for minimal energy usage, Balanced Mode for optimized scheduling, and Performance Mode for high-speed execution, enabling a flexible approach to simulating different system goals. Additionally, the simulator supports CSV file import and export, making it easy to work with large datasets and integrate the tool into broader testing or academic workflows.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this simulator runs entirely in the browser without requiring any backend, ensuring accessibility and ease of use. Whether you're a student exploring operating system algorithms, an educator demonstrating process scheduling concepts, or a developer interested in energy-aware computing, this project offers an engaging and practical learning experience.
